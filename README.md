# CyberCrimeSupport
This repository provides a comprehensive collection of information on various cybercrime reporting and support organizations, primarily focusing on blue team activities. It is designed to help multinational corporations and smaller organizations, especially those that have not yet established connections with law enforcement or local support communities, find and connect with these groups.

The list serves as a starting point for organizations to make initial contact with relevant cybercrime support entities.

We encourage you to contribute details about your team or organizations within your jurisdiction. This list is referenced in SANS LDR553. Please ensure that only publicly available information is posted. Avoid sharing names of agents, staff, or personal mobile numbers unless they are explicitly published as the primary contact information for the department.

All contributions are gratefully appreciated.
